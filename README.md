#Meme-saver

##About

This is just a nice little screensaver like webpage that you can use for your twitch overlay.  The purpose is if you go away you can put up a screen letting your chat know you're gone, but this will provide some entertainment by pulling a random gif from Giphy.

## Setup

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/griggsca91/meme-saver.git
```
Add your Giphy API key in Config.js

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then put the URL defined in the command prompt in your scene!

## To Do
Currently it only pulls in gifs with the tag `dank meme`

* Add tags that it will randomly pull from in the Config.js
